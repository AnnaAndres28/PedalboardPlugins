This is another method of distortion but it doesn't sound nearly as nice as the one being used in the distortion plugin

// two-stage quadratic soft clipping
        for (int channel = 0; channel < buffer.getNumChannels(); ++channel) {
            auto* channelData = buffer.getWritePointer(channel);
            for (int sample = 0; sample < buffer.getNumSamples(); ++sample) {
                float processedSample = channelData[sample] * gainValue; // applying gain
                if (abs(processedSample) > 0.1) {
                    channelData[sample] = processedSample;
                    continue;
                } else if ((0.05 <= abs(processedSample)) && (abs(processedSample) <= 0.1)) {
                    processedSample = copysign((a4Value-pow(2-abs(a4Value*processedSample),2))/a4Value, processedSample); 
                } else {
                    processedSample = 2*processedSample; // ramp up
                }
                channelData[sample] = processedSample;
             }
        }
